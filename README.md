# Data used in cars
In this document, I discuss two articles about how data related with the car industry. Data science is a very useful tool on research and development but also need to aware of the security issue. The two articles have different kinds of view on how data used in car influence consumers. 

## Article 1
In [How high-performance car data will increase EV battery performance](https://thenextweb.com/news/high-performance-car-data-informing-battery-performance), some people argue that by collecting data on EV cars, experts can make the battery more efficient, which actually good for consumers. The engineers collect the battery data through running a software package to increase battery efficiency through not only electrochemistry but also data science. I think although big data is very important for research and development but there should be regulation and surpervising department on data security. 

## Article 2
Contrary to the claims on the issue, The Washington Post's [Carmakers can collect — and sell — too much data about you, watchdog says](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/09/07/car-privacy-mozilla-report/) points out that collecting data from EV is kinds of threat for consumers because they found out that all the car brands collect too much personal data, and even 84% of them sold consumer data. This kinds of car data privacy issue start since EV cars existed. The main reason is that EV cars company usually developed cars that are connected with the internet and bluetooth. As a result, your phone can connected with the car which make the car companies have access to the personal data. In my opinion, I think this is a issue that should be regulated immediately because it may become worse as the information technology developed better and better. Big data is double sided and this technology should be implmented with strict surpervision.
